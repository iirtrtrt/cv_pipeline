# cv_pipeline

## The code is from Taekyung Kim

### The important files are: final.ipynb and google_face_landmark_detection/face_landmark_detection_google.ipynb

### please focus on these two codes

### For final.ipynb, it can generate the reconstruction results by the transformation values in the first block. Through this, the code can find specific camera parameter values at the rotation directories.

### The rotation directories are generated by the Blender file: marilyn_render.blend

### The face_landmark_detection_google.ipynb file at google_face_landmark_detection is for the AI-based reconstruction. This uses only the front image

### The crop.ipynb file has been used to extract only the face

### The Blender files for the results and data preparation can be download via: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EQ2_YjhNKRMyUGH29EpDnKRsG0L94eoq?usp=sharing

### brad.ipynb, brad_crop.ipynb are used to test the Brad Pitt face (no special)

### other_algorithms.ipynb is for testing other feature detection and matching algorithms (no special)

### All results are at final_results.blend and experiment.blend

### Please let me know if you have any question
